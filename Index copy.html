        <h2>CSS explained.</h2>
        <p>
            Here an concept i like to think about when i see CSS, JS, and HTML. html is the bones of the body,
            CSS is the skin of the body, and JS (javascript) is the mucles and vines and vervous system. But lets
            look at the skin. CSS is defined as Cascading Style Sheets. CSS adds style to the website, and allow 
            colors, text fonts, and many more things. like this next piece of text is gonna be...

            CSS code is basic to explain though is complex and expansive.

            the CSS code works using the elements of the html file names/tags listed out some what like picture above
            it may look abit confusing to look at but all you need is the tag and the action you want to do.
            thats the basics of CSS you need to know. the rest is general pratice.

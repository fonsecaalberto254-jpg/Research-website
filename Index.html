            before google or firefox. there was mosaic in the 1980. It was an amazing program allowing people to use HTML
            it was well known in the 1980-1990 for it be able to use text and images on your very own computer
            an marvel of it time. thanks to mosaic we have modern webpages. and before even that there where WAN and LANS
            you might have heard of lan servers since of you played any online games and youre friends didn't have any wifi
            you could host an lan server. WAN servers are wide area networks (lan stands for local area networks). now
            web Development has changed since the beginning. now we have websites like youtube or amazon that allow us to buy
            objects form an websites and they come straight to your door step while you watch your ocean documentry on your cell phone.
